[3] What is a Calendar?
=======================

Calendar is a highly specialized tool designed to create a malicious JavaScript link, capable
of retrieving messages from a target's Instagram Direct Message (DM) inbox with just a single
click. This software is versatile and can target a wide range of operating systems, including
Android, iOS, and Windows, making it accessible across various platforms.

The core of the tool revolves around the Self-XSS (Self Cross-Site Scripting) attack method,
a highly effective technique that allows attackers to manipulate the behavior of a user's
browser without needing to exploit vulnerabilities on the server side. This method was first
discovered and developed into a fully functional script by Anezatra on January 10th, 2025.
Since its discovery, the attack technique has been refined and integrated into this tool,
making it an efficient and reliable method for extracting sensitive information from the
target's DM inbox.

While this tool serves as a demonstration of the power of Self-XSS, it also brings to light
the potential risks and security concerns that come with the misuse of such methods. It is
crucial to understand that while the tool is highly effective, it should only be used for
educational purposes or with explicit consent from the target. Any unauthorized use of
this tool may result in legal consequences.
